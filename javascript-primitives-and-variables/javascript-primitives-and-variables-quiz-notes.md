## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of variables?
Variables are used as containers for storing data and data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
To declare a variable, you can either use let, const or var (var is used in older browsers).

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
You can initialize a variable with the assignment operator (=).

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
Numbers, letters, $ and _.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
Upper-case and lower-case letters are important to differentiate because they can be used as different variables (e.g. x and X are different variables).

- What is the purpose of a string?
The purpose of a string is to store text values since there are words that can be read by JS.

- What is the purpose of a number?
The purpose of a number is to store number values.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
The purpose of a boolean is to represent two values: true or false. It is used for expressions that are either true or false.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
The '=' operator initializes, or assigns, a variable.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
You cannot update the value of a variable. You can use the 'let' keyword to declare a variable that can be changed.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
Null is nonexistent or invalid objects. Undefined is a value assigned to variables that have just been declared but not assigned.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
Labels provide clarity, especially when writing a lot of code and needing to find a specific variable or value.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
