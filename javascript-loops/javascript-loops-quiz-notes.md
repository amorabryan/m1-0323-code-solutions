## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
Loops are used if you want to run the same code over and over a gain using a different value.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
Conditions are expressions evaluated before each pass through a loop. If the condition evaluates to true, then the statement is executed. Otherwise, the loop terminates.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
Iteration meants to run the sequence until the condition is met.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression gets evaluated as long as the condition is true (e.g. i < 10).

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The initialization expression gets evaluated once before the loop begins.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The condition expression gets evaluated before each loop iteration. If it evaluates to true, the statement is executed. If the expression evaluates to false, then the execution exits the loop and goes to the first statement after the for loop.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The final expression of a for loop gets evaluated at the end of each loop iteration. It occurs before the next evaluation of condition. Its used to update or increment the counter variable.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
You can use a 'break' statement to exit a loop.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
It increases a value by one.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
You use a for in loop and use bracket notation to access and push the property values (keys) of the object.
