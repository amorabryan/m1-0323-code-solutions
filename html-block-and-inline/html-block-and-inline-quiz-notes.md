## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
They create rectangular boxes that stretch from the left margin to the right margin of the document. Block elements push down the content below them and do not allow any other elements to be placed beside them. They cause a line break and is used for headings, paragraphs and divs.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
They do not disrupt flow. They are placed within a line of text and do not cause a line break and can be used for formatting text or adding small elements like links and images.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
The default width of a block-level element is 100% of its parent element's width.
The default height of a block-level element is determined by its content and any padding or margin added to it.

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
They do not have a set height and width as they are placed in line of text.
