## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Give five examples of HTML element types.
<head></head> - Contans metadata about the document, like the title, style sheets, etc.
<title></title> - The document's title that shows up on the page's tab or the browser's title bar.
<body></body> - The content of the HTML document.
<h(number)></h(number)> - Section headings, where 1 is the highest and the lowest number is anything after 1.
<div></div> - Container for flow content; has no effect on the content or layout until styled some way using CSS.

- What is the purpose of HTML attributes?
They give extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.

- Give an example of an HTML entity (escape character).
You will need to use character reference equivalent, such as &lt; (<) or &quot; (") since these characters are used in HTML syntax itself.
