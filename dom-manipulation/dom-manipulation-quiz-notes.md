## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
The 'className' property is a string that contains the names of the CSS classes applied to that element.

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
Using the 'classList' property provides methods to add, remove, toggle, or check for the presence of a class.

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
The 'textContent' property of element objects is a string that represents the text content of the element and its descendants without HTML or markup.

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
You can assign a new value to the 'textContent' property of the element.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
It is not always useful, depending on the type of event and the purpose of the listener.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
Yes because it helps storing the click event into a variable and putting the variable back into a function.

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
It provides a more efficient and organized way to manipulate and access data.
