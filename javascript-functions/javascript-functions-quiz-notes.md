## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
Functions are blocks of code that are designed to perform specific tasks.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
'function' keyword, the function name, the parameters (separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses), the start of the function code block '{', an optional return statement, and the end of the function code block '}'.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
the function name and placing parentheses next to it, then any arugments.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
the function definition defines the function, but doesn't do anything unless it is called by the call function. the call function only enacts if the function is defined.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
Parameters are used when defining a function, and arguments are used when calling a function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Parameters allow a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
It ends the execution of the function and returns control to the calling function.
